# ArduinoAudio

Adds Arduino support on the Daisy audio platform. This environment consists of an audio config library, DSP library, and board support using stm32duino.  

### Features

* Circular DMA transfers and reception with user callback.
* Configuration of samplerate.
* flexible callback interface

## Getting Started

The audio library can be installed just like any other Arduino library. Check out this tutorial for instructions. 
https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries

To add the Daisy board to your Arduino IDE, follow these instructions from stm32duino.

## Running the examples

Running the example programs works the same way that all Arduino examples work. Click file->examples, and then scroll all the way to the bottom to until you see the "Audio" tab. You can then select one of our audio specific example programs. 

## Built With

* [Arduino](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino) - The web framework used
* [stm32duino](https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32) - Arduino Support for STM32 MCUs
